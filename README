bin2c - A simple utility for converting a binary file to a c application which
can then be included within an application.

Usage:

bin2c input_file output_file array_name

for example, using:
    bin2c my_file.dat my_file.h data

will create something along the lines of

   const char data[] = {
       0x43, 0x28, 0x41, 0x11, 0xa3, 0xff,
       ...
       0x00, 0xff, 0x23
   };
   
   const int data_length = 3432;

This can then be used within your application, for example with SDL you would
use SDL_RWops. The application can also be used in a very similar fashion to
Qt's RC system.

I haven't included a Makefile because the utility is SO simple, I don't
think that one is needed. But for an example, compiling for GNU/Linux can be
done as shown

   gcc -o bin2c bin2c.c

Patches are welcome, just fork the project on github and send me a pull
request. If you are unable or unwilling to do this through github, then feel
free to email me your patch. This utility is so small I don't think that any
licence is needed, and I took most of the code from Serge Fukanchick and made
a few modifications so left it in the public domain. So please just send me a
little note to say that you don't mind your code being in the public domain.
